<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> What can you tell me about docker? Describe the various steps needed to get an app ran inside a docker container in your own words</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>A Docker container is like a separate workspace for running processes on a<br>host machine, isolated from other workspaces. It relies on Linux kernel features such<br>as namespaces and cgroups to achieve this isolation. Containers are essentially executable versions<br>of Docker images, and they can be easily managed using Docker's tools. They're<br>highly portable, capable of running on various platforms, and they maintain independence from<br>other containers.</div><div><br></div><div>On the other hand, a Docker image serves as a template for<br>a container. It contains all the components necessary to run an application, including<br>files, settings, scripts, and binaries. Docker images also include specific container details, like<br>environment variables and the default command to execute. These images are fundamental to<br>creating and running containers, ensuring that applications run consistently and reliably across different<br>environments.</div><div><br></div><div>Related links :&nbsp;https://docs.docker.com/get-started/</div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> What is Heroku? Why do you feel it was chosen for this class?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>Heroku is a cloud platform ideal for educational settings due to its simplicity,<br>making it an excellent choice for teaching web development. It abstracts away the<br>complexities of server management, allowing students to focus on coding. Heroku offers straightforward<br>deployment processes, enabling students to quickly see their applications live on the web.<br>It supports multiple programming languages, making it suitable for classes that teach various<br>technologies. The platform's add-ons simplify integrating databases and other services, streamlining the development<br>process.</div><div>Additionally, Heroku provides lessons in scalability, teaching students how to handle increased demand<br>for their projects. With a supportive community and extensive documentation, Heroku serves as<br>a valuable resource for both students and instructors. Heroku's user-friendly platform and rapid<br>development capabilities, which facilitate effective web development is the reason for its choice<br>to use in class.</div><div><br></div><div>Related Link :&nbsp;https://mentormate.com/blog/what-is-heroku-used-for-cloud-development/</div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> What is flask? List a few things you learned about it</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Flask, a Python web framework, is renowned for its simplicity and adaptability, making<br>it an ideal choice for constructing web applications and RESTful APIs. It boasts<br>features like URL routing, template rendering, and a range of extensions for enhanced<br>capabilities. Flask&#39;s streamlined design and vibrant community render it a top pick for<br>smaller to mid-sized projects, aligning perfectly with the preferences of Python developers due<br>to its Pythonic principles.<div><br></div><div>Related Link:&nbsp;<a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/">https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/</a></div><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 4: </em> What is the difference between a Dockerfile and a Github Action .yml file?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>A Dockerfile is a set of instructions that details how to construct a<br>container image, outlining the application&#39;s environment and requirements. On the other hand, a<br>GitHub Action .yml file is a configuration that orchestrates automated workflows, specifying the<br>actions to be taken in response to GitHub repository events like building, testing,<br>and deploying code. While the Dockerfile deals with image creation, the GitHub Action<br>.yml file is dedicated to automating diverse development and deployment tasks within the<br>GitHub platform.<br></p><br></td></tr>
